			<h1>"The Engineering Academy is a premier programme to develop Engineering Innovators." <br>- SP Website</h1>
			<p>Engineering Academy gives me many opportunities to widen my skillset and explore limitless boundries in expressing my creativity with well equipped FabLab facilities. </p>
			<p> <br>FabLab facilities gave me the opportunity to learn different crucial skills. <br>Example: 3D Printing Machines are readily available for me to 3D print designs I have made in Fusion 360 using Ultimaker Cura. </p>

			<h1>Project 1:<br>Fusion 360</h1>
			<p>In Fusion 360, I created 3D design of a NameTag.</p>
			<p>Using Commands: Fillet to smoothen out the sharp egdes and making it rounder, <br>Creating a Sketch to be able to create a 2D design first,<br>Extrude to transform the 2D sketch into a 3D design, <br>Text to be able to type my name into the surface of the design and extruding <br>it afterwards to have my name appearing to Pop Out.</p>
			<p> <br> I also created a 3D design of a Queen Chesspiece.</p>

			<h1>Project 4:<br>T-Shirt Design and Printing</h1>
			<p>I created a design of my shirt using Canva as it was very easy to use and does not require download. <br> Exporting it in SVG format whuch makes use of Vectors makes the image quality much more sharper than PNG format.</p>
